**Quality Score Calculation Examples:**

**1.1 Incoming Quality (Parts Per Million Defective)**
```
PPM = (Defective Parts / Total Parts Received) × 1,000,000

- PPM > 10,000: 0 points (Unacceptable)

Example: 15 defective parts out of 10,000 received
PPM = (15 / 10,000) × 1,000,000 = 1,500 PPM → 80 points
```

**1.2 First-Pass Acceptance Rate**
```
Acceptance Rate = (Lots Accepted on First Inspection / Total Lots) × 100%
