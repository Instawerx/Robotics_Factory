Letter of Intent (LOI)
Executive Summary

C12 Robotics is building the first vertically integrated U.S.-based humanoid robotics factory, focused on high-ROI industrial and defense applications, with a roadmap to serve medical and public infrastructure use cases. Our core innovation lies in modular humanoids that operate existing equipment, simulation-first AI training, and robots building robots. We are targeting $1.9B in revenue and 25,000+ units/year by Year 5 through a capital-efficient phased manufacturing ramp.




Market Opportunity

Industrial Use Case TAM: $31B+ by 2033 (warehousing, logistics, manufacturing)

Agriculture Operator TAM: $47B global opportunity with 30% underutilized equipment

Defense/DoD: $1B+ DoD autonomy budget (FY2026), expanding NDAA-compliant solutions demand

Medical & Public Sector: $22B service robotics market by 2030, including hospital logistics and patient interaction




LTV:CAC Correction

Corrected CAC: $267,000 per enterprise customer acquisition (pilot, integration, onboarding)

Corrected LTV: $1.5M gross lifetime value per customer

LTV:CAC Ratio: 5.6× — reflecting multi-year deployments with 10+ robots per customer at $120k ASP and 45% gross margin

Payback Period: 8–9 months at $12,000/month RaaS with >50% margin

NDAA Compliance and Unitree Transition Plan

Phase 1 (Months 0–18): Use Unitree G1s on non-DoD production lines only. Marked "Commercial Only" per NDAA guidelines.

Phase 2 (Months 18–36): Begin internal manufacturing of compliant U.S.-sourced humanoids for factory automation

Phase 3 (Months 36+): Full NDAA-compliant humanoid factory and product lines for DoD/government markets

Defense Variants: Only use in-house robots with verified U.S. origin components (verified via part-level sourcing log)

ISO 13485 Justification

Reason for Pursuit: Establish a core quality and traceability system (QMS) via ISO 13485 on base slug humanoid model

Use Case: Enables hospital logistics, assisted care, and infection control tasks

Transition Readiness: Allows certification extensions (e.g. IEC 60601) for FDA Class I/II service robot tasks later
