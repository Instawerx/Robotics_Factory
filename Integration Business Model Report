Community Robotics Proposal and Business Model Report 

Integration First Approach
Public Sector Adoption: Telepresence Robots for Community Benefit
Government and state agencies are well-positioned to pioneer the use of telepresence and autonomous
robots to address labor shortages and safety risks in public services. A prime example is in building and
electrical inspections – roles that often face staffing gaps and require travel to multiple sites. By deploying
telepresence robotics, one inspector can remotely cover many locations, increasing efficiency while
reducing the need for physical travel.

Feasibility and Early Examples: Remote virtual inspections have already gained traction in U.S. cities. For
instance, Philadelphia launched a Virtual Inspections Program allowing certified inspectors to guide on-site
personnel via smartphone video, resulting in “safer, faster, and more convenient” inspections .
Inspectors handle more appointments per day and reduce carbon emissions from driving . This success
suggests that a mobile telepresence robot – essentially a roving camera with two-way communication –
could further enhance such programs by eliminating the need for a person on-site to hold the camera. In
practice, a robot can move through buildings, perform visual assessments, and interact with on-site
staff under the inspector’s control . This enables “remote in-person collaboration” where the inspector
virtually “walks” the job site, checking code compliance in real time . Agencies benefit by increasing
inspection frequency, saving travel time, and improving safety, as demonstrated by telepresence trials
in manufacturing settings .

Safety and Labor Advantages: Adopting robots for public-sector tasks addresses critical labor and safety
issues. Nationally, there are severe skilled-worker shortages and dangerous tasks in fields like infrastructure
and utilities . Teleoperated or autonomous robots can mitigate these problems. For example, a
humanoid robot inspector (or a drone/vehicle it operates) can handle hazardous inspections (electrical
panels, confined spaces) without putting human inspectors at risk. This aligns with the trend of using robots
in hazardous environments such as nuclear facilities or high-voltage areas, a priority highlighted by
federal programs . By multiplying the reach of one expert across many sites, governments can fill
skill gaps: one seasoned electrical inspector could supervise many more inspections via robots, addressing
staffing shortfalls in building departments. Indeed, a core promise of telepresence robotics is “One expert →
multiple sites simultaneously”, multiplying expertise 3–5× over traditional methods . Early adopters in
government report that such technology leads to 50–70% cost reductions and zero safety incidents in
pilot programs .

Community Benefits: When government agencies adopt automation, the community gains from faster
services, safer operations, and workforce development opportunities. By making inspections more
efficient, construction projects face fewer delays – a boon to local economic activity. Safety improves
because robots can take on perilous tasks (climbing, entering disaster sites, etc.), reducing workplace
injuries. Importantly, public-sector adoption sets a precedent that encourages education and training in
the community. For example, city governments can partner with local technical colleges to train workers to
operate and maintain these robots, creating new skilled jobs (robot operator, maintenance tech) to support
the initiative. This model echoes what private industry is doing – investing in upskilling – but in a civic
context. The overall message is that government-led robotics programs are not about eliminating jobs, but
rather “preparing the labor force for the kind of work that is likely to be required” in the future . In
Philadelphia’s case, virtual inspections introduced during the pandemic are now a permanent service
upgrade , demonstrating public willingness to embrace tech that makes services more accessible and
efficient. A community proposal built on these principles would likely find support, as it promises better
public services, prudent use of taxpayer funds (through efficiency), and local tech job creation.

Private Sector Model: Automation in Local Factories (Benefit for All)
Equally important is a business-focused model for robotics adoption that ensures local factories and
private enterprises can leverage automation to benefit both the company and the community stakeholders
(employees, customers, and the regional economy). The key is framing automation not as a replacement of
the workforce, but as a tool that augments human labor, handling repetitive or dangerous tasks while
humans move to higher-value roles. This approach can address labor shortages and boost productivity
without the dystopian outcome of mass layoffs.

Business Case for Automation: Facing a chronic labor shortage in manufacturing (an estimated 2.1 million
unfilled U.S. manufacturing jobs) , many factories are turning to robots to maintain operations.

Automation offers well-documented benefits: it “plugs labor gaps, boosts productivity and throughput, and
improves production quality” . For example, collaborative robots (cobots) can take over simple assembly
or material handling tasks, allowing the company to increase output without overworking existing staff.
One hidden benefit is improved safety and ergonomics – robots can handle heavy lifts or monotonous
tasks, meaning employees face fewer injuries and can be reassigned to supervisory or creative duties. In
fact, companies have found that automation “bakes in” productivity gains that were previously limited by
human fatigue or variability . Additionally, adopting automation can make local firms more competitive
with larger or overseas rivals by lowering costs per unit and enabling 24/7 operations. A World Economic
Forum study noted that at scale, smart automation can even encourage businesses to reshore or
regionalize manufacturing, since robotics diminish the labor cost advantage of offshoring . This
means a local factory that automates efficiently could expand and create more jobs locally in the long run,
rather than sending work abroad.

Workforce Upskilling and Retention: To ensure automation “benefits all,” a local factory must pair its
robotics deployment with a robust upskilling program for its employees. The positive news: many forwardthinking 
companies have shown that automation and workforce development go hand in hand. No one has to be left behind. 
For example, manufacturing giant Flex found that introducing robotics did not lead to
layoffs among factory floor workers; instead, “workers have been redeployed or transferred to other production
needs or upskilled to specialized roles”. Assembly operators became line auditors or robotics technicians, and
no mass workforce reductions occurred . This real-world case confirms academic findings that while
automation changes the nature of jobs, it also creates new tasks and roles, often enough to offset job
losses in net terms . Companies like Amazon are investing heavily in this philosophy – Amazon
committed over $1.2 billion to upskill 300,000 U.S. employees by 2025 for in-demand roles like robotics
technician and machine learning specialist . Manufacturers Siemens and Rockwell have similarly
partnered with education programs to train workers in automation technology, noting that a person
programming or maintaining a robot earns more (and provides more value) than someone doing repetitive
manual work .

From a methodology standpoint, a local factory can implement automation beneficially in several steps:
Identify Tasks Suited for Automation: Start with the most routine, hazardous, or bottleneck
tasks on the factory floor. Common candidates include material handling, assembly of simple
components, packaging, quality inspection, and equipment tending. These are tasks robots excel at,
often achieving 70–90% automation suitability with current vision and grip technologies . By
automating these, human workers are freed for jobs that require flexibility and problem-solving
(maintenance, improvement projects, custom work). Crucially, involve the front-line employees in
this assessment – their input will highlight pain points that robots could relieve (e.g. a particularly
injury-prone lifting task).

Choose an Adoption Model (Purchase vs. Service): One major business-model innovation
making automation accessible to smaller firms is Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS). Instead of
purchasing robots outright for a large capital expense, companies can subscribe to robot services.
Under RaaS, a vendor provides the robot (and often maintenance/support) for a monthly fee. This
dramatically lowers the entry barrier – “No $150–250K upfront capital required” . Many industrial
customers prefer this model; industry analysis projects over 70% of manufacturing clients may
opt for RaaS subscriptions rather than buying robots, especially among small and mid-sized
manufacturers . For example, if a humanoid robot costs $150K to buy, a RaaS model might offer
it at ~$8K per month, which can yield a positive ROI within 12–18 months by increasing production
uptime . The company benefits from predictable operating costs and up-to-date tech (the
vendor will handle upgrades), while the community benefits because even smaller local factories
can afford automation, not just large corporations. This democratization of automation ensures
wider economic benefits – more local businesses remain competitive and keep jobs local.

Implement Gradually & Retrain Workers: When rolling out robots, a phased approach works best.
Begin with a pilot in one department or task, and offer training to the affected workers before
and during deployment. This could mean certifying current employees as robot operators or
maintenance techs. Not only does this approach leverage the workers’ experience (they know the
workflow best), but it also signals job security – the robot is a tool for them to use, not a
replacement. Indeed, experts emphasize that companies should facilitate internal mobility for
workers: retrain staff to shift roles within the firm so they don’t have to fear displacement . Even
short technical courses can enable an operator to manage a robotic cell – many upskilling programs
are “micro” in nature, sometimes just a few days or weeks for basic robotics or data literacy training.

Leverage Public-Private Training Resources: There are numerous workforce development
programs in the United States designed to help businesses train workers on new technology. A local
factory should tap into these state and local incentives for training. For instance, Georgia’s Quick
Start program – the oldest in the nation – provides free, customized training for companies
implementing new technology, and has upgraded the skills of over 1 million employees across 6,500
projects . Other states offer similar programs or grants (North Carolina, Mississippi, Virginia,
and others provide tax credits or funding to firms that invest in employee training for automation).
Local Workforce Development Boards can also partner with companies to anticipate skill needs;
by maintaining close relationships, they “can organize training programs or assist with new technology
implementation” in sync with a company’s automation plans . In short, a community’s educational
infrastructure (technical colleges, workforce agencies) can be aligned with the factory’s automation
roadmap, ensuring a pipeline of skilled local workers and minimizing displacement.

Monitor Outcomes and Share the Gains: As automation is integrated, management should track
metrics like productivity, quality improvements, reduction in injuries, and employee satisfaction. The
gains from automation – higher output and potentially higher profit – should be shared in
some form to sustain the “benefit all” philosophy. In practice, many companies do this by raising
wages for upskilled positions (a certified robotics technician earns more than an assembler, for
example), offering performance bonuses, or even reducing the workweek without reducing pay if
efficiency allows. While specific approaches vary, the goal is that workers see a tangible reward from
the productivity increases. This boosts morale and acceptance of automation. It also addresses a
broader economic challenge: as automation expands, ensuring workers have a stake (through
higher skills and income) is key to avoiding inequality. Some forward-looking analyses suggest that
in an age of advanced automation, more workers may need to have an ownership stake or profitsharing arrangement 
in the enterprise to truly thrive .  In family-owned or small factories, this could be as simple as profit-sharing 
bonuses; in larger ones, it could mean stock ownership plans or forming cooperatives for certain automated 
operations. The specifics might go beyond our current scope, but the principle is clear – when people feel invested 
in the new technology, they're more likely to support and improve it, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and inclusive growth.

Aligning Public and Private Strategies
Both the community (public sector) proposal and the private business model approach share a common
vision: using robotics and AI to multiply human capability, not marginalize it. In the public sector, that
means more efficient and safe services (e.g. inspectors, first responders, utility maintenance) delivered
without increasing costs or risking workers. In the private sector, it means competitive local industries
that provide better jobs. Crucially, these two realms can reinforce each other. Governments can act as early
adopters and smart regulators, proving out use cases like remote inspections and setting safety and
certification standards for robotics. This, in turn, normalizes the technology and builds trust. Meanwhile, the
private sector’s innovations (in business models like RaaS or techniques like simulation training) provide the
tools that public agencies can leverage.

In the United States context, support for such integrated strategies is growing. Public-private partnerships
are emerging around workforce training for automation – for example, manufacturers partnering with state
programs and community colleges to create apprenticeship-style pipelines for robotics skills .
Federal initiatives (like the Department of Energy’s funding for robotics in hazardous industries ) also
encourage companies to develop technology that can be used in both industry and civic infrastructure. 

The end goal is a sustainable ecosystem: local factories and businesses adopt automation in a way that creates
better jobs and higher productivity, and local governments adopt automation in a way that improves
services and safety. Both contribute to community well-being and economic resilience.

Exploring a “business version” of the community robotics proposal based on principles
of inclusion, training, and smart deployment apply universally. Whether it’s a city deploying an
inspection robot or a factory installing an automated line, success depends on how well humans are
integrated with the new technology. When done right, automation can “go hand in hand” with job
creation and enrichment, not destruction . It requires proactive measures – training programs,
imaginative business models like RaaS, and perhaps new ownership structures – lower costs and higher 
output, yes, but also a safer, more skilled workforce and a communitythat thrives alongside technological progress.
