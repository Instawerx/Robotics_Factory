## 🏭 MANUFACTURING STRATEGY

### "Robots Building Robots" Model

**The Innovation**: Use affordable robots as primary assembly workforce

**Economics**:
```
USA Traditional:
- 100 workers @ $54K = $5.4M/year

C12's Robot Manufacturing:
- 80 robots @ $2,075/year = $166K/year
- 20 supervisors @ $75K = $1.5M/year
- Total: $1.67M/year

Savings: $3.73M/year (69% reduction)
Quality: +40% (more consistent)
Speed: +60% (24/7 operation)
```

**This makes USA manufacturing cost-competitive with China.**
